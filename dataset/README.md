"Welcome to DUDâ€¢E, an enhanced and rebuilt version of DUD, 
a directory of useful decoys. DUD-E is designed to help 
benchmark molecular docking programs by providing challenging 
decoys."

 - 22,886 active compounds and their affinities against 102 targets, an average of 224 ligands per target
 - 50 decoys for each active having similar physico-chemical properties but dissimilar 2-D topology.
